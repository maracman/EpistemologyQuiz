In other words, there is no way to derive how someone should act from what we can observe about what “is” in the world. Many people believe in the existence of objective moral truths, such as &quot;killing is wrong”, the opinion that such values are objective and universal is not likely to be defensible from a pure correspondence theory of truth.

            One famous thinker who had a Correspondence Theory of truth is Bertrand Russell, a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, and social critic.
            </p>
            <p>
            One important idea that Russell advanced in his philosophy is his theory of descriptions. According to this theory, definite descriptions such as "the present king of France" do not actually refer to anything if there is no such entity that satisfies the description. This theory has had a significant impact on the philosophy of language and has been widely discussed and debated by philosophers.

            <em>Coherence Theory:</em> According to this theory, a belief is true if it coherently fits within an existing system of beliefs. Truth is determined by the logical consistency and coherence of a proposition with other accepted propositions. This theory emphasises the interconnectedness of beliefs and suggests that truth is relative to a particular conceptual framework or belief system.

            <h4>Challenges to the coherence theory of truth:</h4>


            <h3>1. <em>Coherent theories might not match up to what we observe about the world.</em></h3>


            <p>
            The fantasy worlds of J.K Rowling, George R.R. Martin or J.R.R Tolkien are surprisingly fleshed out and coherent, yet what would you think if one of your friends suddenly professed claimed that they were true and accurate depictions of reality? On what grounds would you coax them back to the world they were actually living in?
            </p>
            <h3>2. <em>What do you do if your belief system isn’t coherent?</em></h3>


            <p>
            Arguably very few people in this world have an entirely coherent system of beliefs. Imagine, for instance, you hold two competing systems such that exactly 50% of your beliefs adhere to one system and 50% to another. What criteria would you use to decide which half of your beliefs to relinquish? The coherence theory doesn’t appear to hold the solution.
            </p>
            <p>
            Even if a very small percentage of your beliefs were in conflict with the others, should you really get rid of them? perhaps those small sets of beliefs are the beliefs that you get the most practical use from and help you to live day to day.

            <strong>You hold most closely to the Coherence Theory of truth.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            This theory asserts that truth is a matter of coherence and consistency with a broader system of beliefs. Some famous thinkers associated with this theory include Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Susan Haack.
            </p>
            <p>

                Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz argued against the prevailing philosophical view of his time known as the "materialism" or "mechanistic worldview" and argued that truth is instead a matter of coherence within a system of interconnected beliefs. He believed that all truths are related to each other and that there is a fundamental harmony between them.
            </p>
            <p>

                Haack, on the other hand, developed a version of the coherence theory called "foundherentism." She argued that truth is a matter of coherence with both experience and the web of beliefs.

If accepting a belief leads to successful outcomes or helps solve problems, it is considered true. Pragmatic theorists emphasise the functional and instrumental aspects of truth rather than its relationship to objective reality or coherence within a belief system.

            <h4>Challenges to the Pragmatic Theory of truth:</h4>


            <h3><em>1. Misleading pragmatisms.</em></h3>


            <p>
            The belief in lucky charms or superstitions can be useful for some people, providing confidence or control in uncertain situations. However, there may be no objective evidence to support the effectiveness of these charms or superstitions, making it difficult to reconcile their practical usefulness with their lack of correspondence to reality.
            </p>
            <h3><em>2. Things that we see are true but hold no practical purpose.</em></h3>


            <p>
            Much of what we observe we say is true because we can predict it with more or less 100% certainty, but holds no practical purpose. Scientific discovery is made with this in mind, it is interested in things being true because they are replicable, driven by curiosity, practical applications of scientific discovery often comes much later, yet we would probably still say that it is true before this point.
            </p>
            <h3><em>3. Competing motivations</em></h3>


            <p>
            Pragmatism is dependent on motivational end-points. What if someone’s motivation was chaos and destruction? Even the basic building blocks of causation might hold no practical use to them. For instance, the truth of the car hurtling towards them as they cross the road cannot be derived from their standpoint. Perhaps then, pragmatic truth can only be the case as far as we are loosely bound together by humanity’s common goals of survival and reproduction.

            This theory asserts that truth is a matter of usefulness or practicality. Some famous thinkers associated with this theory include Charles Sanders Peirce and William James.
            </p>
            <p>

                Peirce and James were arguing against a philosophical movement known as positivism or scientism. Rejecting this view, they argued that there were other valid forms of inquiry beyond science, such as philosophy and psychology, that could lead to meaningful knowledge. 
            </p>
            <p>

                Pierce and James believed that truth was dictated by what found was pragmatic, but disagreed about the motivation. Peirce argued that truth is a matter of what helps us successfully predict and control the world. James, on the other hand, argued that truth is a matter of what satisfies our needs and desires.

            <p>
            At one time, the consensus was that the Earth is flat, which was considered true within that historical context. How can we say that it <em>was</em> true then but is <em>no longer</em> true when nothing about the form and function of the earth and surrounding bodies has altered? External reality in this framework is bound up in the triviality of opinion, and historically establishing what is actually “true” is how we challenge trivially held positions.

            Under this paradigm, what is true depends on who you include in the group by which you are measuring the consensus. In a sample of one, whatever you believe is automatically the truth, as we expand the boundary the measurement becomes more difficult. Another question you might ask is whether or not, under this paradigm, there is a perfect democracy, or should some people, perhaps those with the relevant expertise, count more than others? And might we also need to include the beliefs of possible alien intelligences, how would we measure these if we don't know about their existence?

            <h3><em>1. It seems sort of antiquated</em></h3>


            <p>
            Descartes' famous phrase, "Cogito, ergo sum" (I think, therefore I am), emphasizes the primacy of the mind in defining the self. However, modern neuroscience has shown that many mental processes are closely tied to brain activity and bodily functions. This connection challenges the idea of a separate, non-physical mind or soul as the essence of the self.
            </p>
            <h3><em>2. The interaction problem</em></h3>


            <p>
            The problem of interaction in substance dualism refers to the challenge of explaining how the immaterial mind can interact with the physical brain. The issue here is that mental events are not reducible to physical events, yet they seem to influence the workings of the brain, which is a physical organ.
            </p>
            <p>
            To solve this problem, substance dualism would need to either redefine our understanding of the physical to include a mechanism for interaction with the non-physical, or posit a third substance that serves as the point of interaction between the mind and body. However, this creates new problems, such as defining this third substance and how it relates to the mind and body.
            </p>
            <p>
            As we delve deeper into this problem, we are faced with the inevitability of defining everything as either mental or material and, therefore, denying the existence of one or the other.

            While materialism posits that consciousness and self-awareness are products of complex physical systems, it struggles to explain the subjective nature of conscious experience, known as the "hard problem of consciousness". That is that there is something “it is like” to be you or me, something that we do not attribute to mechanical processes. Under this definition, we cannot say that a clothes iron or a ballpoint pen do not have their own senses of self.

            <h3><em>2. The Explanatory Gap</em></h3>


            <p>
            The explanatory gap refers to the impossibility of explaining subjective experiences through appeal to mechanical processes alone. Indeed the unique features of consciousness seem to resist reduction to any physical explanations. Additionally, as materialism can describe all observed phenomena through cause and effect without evoking a need for consciousness, it becomes a closed loop leaving phenomenal experience out altogether.

            <h3><em>3. The Problem of Mental Causation </em></h3>


            <p>
            Materialism may also struggle to account for how mental events, such as beliefs and desires, can cause things to happen in the material world. If mental events are reducible to physical events in the brain, then how can they cause physical events outside of the brain, such as the movement of the arm?

This is at the core of what the question “What is the self?” is trying to answer.

            <p>
            Representationalism says that our minds create internal models of the world around us. But how can we know if these models are accurate? To check if our models are correct, we would need to create more mental models to compare them. This creates a never-ending cycle of models, making it impossible to know if our perception is accurate. Think about it like this: imagine trying to decide if a photo is accurate by comparing it to another photo, and then comparing that photo to another photo, and so on - you would never be able to tell if any of the photos are truly accurate.

            <p>
            Representationalism doesn't explain how our mental models turn into conscious experiences. For example, we know that we have mental models of objects like chairs, but how does this mental model become the experience of seeing and sitting on a chair? The theory doesn't provide a clear answer to this question.

If our perceptions are based only on our personal mental models, how can we explain the way we communicate and understand each other's experiences? If our mental models are unique to each of us, how can we share our experiences with others and understand what they are trying to tell us about their own experiences?

If your mental models are unique and private to each of you, how can you be sure that you're both talking about the same painting and not just describing your own individual perceptions?

            <p>
            One challenge to constructivism is the question of how we can have objective perceptions of the world if our perceptions are influenced by our experiences and beliefs. If two people perceive the same event or object differently due to their individual backgrounds, how can we determine whose perception is more accurate, or if there even is a "correct" perception? For example, imagine two people looking at an optical illusion. One person sees the illusion, while the other doesn't. How do we decide whose perception is more accurate?

            <p>
            Constructivism struggles to explain how infants and young children can perceive the world accurately before they have had many experiences to shape their perceptions. If our perceptions are constructed based on our experiences, how do infants and young children make sense of the world around them? Think about a baby who can recognize their mother's face - how do they do this if they don't yet have many experiences to build their perceptions?

            <p>
            The evolutionary perspective of perception assumes that our perceptual abilities have evolved to help us survive in our environment. However, this assumption may not hold up in cases where our environment changes faster than our ability to adapt. For example, humans are not well adapted to modern technologies like cars or computers, which can lead to accidents or errors in perception. This suggests that our perceptual abilities may have limits and cannot always keep up with changes in our environment.
