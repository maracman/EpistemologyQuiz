This Github is hosting the MyEpistemology.com quiz. 

This quis is designed as an educational tool, based on evidence that increased deep-epistemological uncertainty correlates with accademic success — argued in the paper included titled "Promoting Knowledge Uncertainty: An Educational Intervention Through Philosophical Inquiry"
This paper is included in the hosted files.

If you intend to use this tool as an educational resource please encourage students to write down their thoughts after reading each big question and or reading through the possible responses. This is important in order for proper querying of our assumed beleifs. 

The quiz follows the format below:
The student is presented with an epistemological topic and asked to discuss or think about it using a scaffold of four questions to guide the discussion.

The student is presented with a series of  quotes and are asked to identify with one of them based on what they have resolved from their prior discussion.

The student encounters counterarguments rooted in philosophical thought experiments, which underscore possible contradictions with other held beliefs.
After reading through these issues, students are encouraged to reconsider their initial stance.

Once the student has gone through this process for all the topics 1) “Thinking about the nature of truth”, 2) “Thinking about the nature of the self”, and 3) “Thinking about the nature of perception”, they are presented with a result page. This page summarises their beliefs and allows them to identify with prominent thinkers of the past and present who hold to these positions. 
This page serves to make the exercise more engaging for the students and should not be used to judge the student's merit.
